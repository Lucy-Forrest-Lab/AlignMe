4.3) Output files
-----------------

**--*output\_aligned\_sequences \<filename\>***

Provide the name of a file to which the alignment will be written. By
default the alignment is written to a file called
"aligned\_sequences.aln" when generating a sequence-to-sequence
alignment.

**--*output\_aligned\_profiles \<filename\>***

Provide the name of a file to which an alignment of the input profiles
will be written. By default the alignment will be written to a file
called "aligned\_profiles.aln" when aligning averaged multiple sequence
alignments.

**--*profile\_gap\_value\_for\_plotting \<value\>***

By default gaps will be written as a "?0" in the output profile
alignment. This option is particularly useful for plotting your aligned
sequences including gaps (e.g., with gnuplot or the attached perl-script
"reformat\_profile\_output.pl" and xmgrace ).
