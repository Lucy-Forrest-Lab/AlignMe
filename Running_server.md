### Pairwise Sequence Alignment

There are three required inputs for every AlignMe calculation:
1) the first [sequence or profile](#sequence-or-profile-inputs)
2) the second [sequence or profile](#sequence-or-profile-inputs)
3) a file containing the similarity metrics to be used, or ["similarity score file"](#similarity-score-file)

These inputs can be combined to run AlignMe in a number of different modes. General information about the required inputs is given below. Specific examples of various standard alignment types are provided here:
1. [Pair-wise Sequence-to-sequence](#sequence\-to\-sequence-alignments). These are the most common.
2. [Alignment of two Multiple Sequence Alignments](#Alignment-of-two-Multiple-Sequence-Alignments)
3. [Pair-wise profile-to-profile alignments](#Pair\-wise-profile\-to\-profile-alignments)
