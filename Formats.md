This section describes the formats of the various inputs read in by AlignMe:
- [Fasta](#Fasta)
- [Similarity matrices](#Similarity-matrices) 
- [PSSMs](#Position-specific-substitution-matrices)
- [Scales](#Scales)
- [Profiles](#Profiles)  

It also describes the types of smoothing methods that can be used with scales for hydropathy (aka family-averaged) alignments. 

## FASTA

For fasta format, the first line of each file has to start with '>' symbol followed by a
header (which is usually the name of the sequence but can also be left
blank). All other text in these files is taken to be the amino acid
sequence. If more than one '>' symbol is found, only the sequence
following the first '>' symbol will be used, and an appropriate warning
will be given. Example of a file in fasta format:

`>Header information and sequence identifier  
ACDEFGIHALALASDFSFEURSTLASSDFSFEURSTLAS  
QEERSLGITLSSDFSFEURSTLASSDFSFEURSTLASSQ`  

## Similarity matrices

To align sequences in the traditional manner, i.e. with the
SequenceSimilarity option, requires a similarity or substitution matrix that defines the likelihood
of substituting one amino acid type with another. The following is an
example of a matrix file in the correct format (i.e. BLOSUM62)

height="2.9444444444444446in"}

## Position Specific Substitution Matrices

In contrast to general substitution matrices, Position Specific
Substitution matrices have different substitution rates for each
sequence position. The first column contains the number of the sequence
position, the second column the amino acid at this positions and the
following 20 columns are the rates of the amino acid from the second
column to be replaced by one of the 20 standard amino acids (shown in
line 2). Please note that AlignMe only supports PSSM that have a comment
like â€žLast position-specific\..." in the first line, followed by the 20
standard amino acids in the second line and all other amino acids in the
next lines:

## Scales 

For aligning two sequences according to a scale such as a hydrophobicity
scale, the ScaleSimilarity mode is used. This requires an input file in
which each of the two amino-acid types is assigned a value on the scale.
Thus, the similarity between two amino acids is the difference between
their scale values. The following is an example input scale file (i.e.
Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity
scale.![](media/image12.png){width="0.9305555555555556in"
height="2.8472222222222223in"}

## Profiles

AlignMe allows for alignments of any kind of profiles like secondary
structure predictions obtained from PsiPred (left) or membrane
predictions from OCTOPUS (right). The user has to choose the column from
which the values should be taken from and it is possible to skip
commented lines using the "headerlines" option in the
*similarity\_score\_file*.

height="1.7638888888888888in"} ![](media/image14.png){width="3.75in"
height="1.7361111111111112in"}

### Smoothing methods

Alignments with hydrophobicity scales allow the usage of sliding windows
to generate a smoothed hydrophobicity plot that is not based on
single amino acid positions only but also takes neighboring amino acids
into account. The supported sliding window types are: 
None, [triangular](#triangular), [rectangular](#rectangular),
[sinusoidal](#sinusoidal) and [zigzag](#zigzag).

#### rectangular

In a rectangular window the (hydrophobicity) values of all amino acids
within the window contribute equally to the total, which is then divided
by the width of the window. This value is then assigned to the position
at the window centre, so that the values of the neighboring residues are
effectively used to smooth out the profile. This option may be used in
combination with a 6 gap-penalty set to subdivide the sequence into two
regions with different gap penalties according to a threshold value (see
section 4.2).

#### triangular

The principle of a triangular window is similar to that of a rectangular
window but emphasizes the value associated with the amino acid at the
centre of the window, whereas the contribution of values either side
decreases linearly from the central position. Thus, profiles become
smoothed, but less drastically than in the case of the rectangular
window. This option is may be useful in combination with a 6 gap-penalty
set and a threshold value (see section 4.2).

#### sinusoidal

In sinusoidal averaging, the contribution of amino-acid positions either
side of the central position will vary according to a sine wave. Thus,
every 3.4th amino acid will contribute fully to the averaging, whereas
every 1.7th amino acid contributes nothing to the averaging. Such
sinusoidal window-averaging may be useful for aligning proteins
consisting mainly of alpha helices because it mimics the periodicity of
amino acid properties in a helix. Thus, for a position that is on a
hydrophobic face of a helix, its score will be averaged along with other
hydrophobic residues, but not with the hydrophilic residues in-between.

#### zigzag

A zigzag window tries to imitate the alternating hydrophobicity pattern
of a beta-sheet (i.e. one side is hydrophobic and the other
hydrophilic). Starting from the window-centre (i) every second amino
acid contributes to the averaging of the central residue.

Example for a window size of 5:

Positions i-2, i, i-2 contribute to the average, whereas positions i-1
and i+1 have no effect on the average.

Currently, only one averaging type is supported for alignments of
averaged multiple sequence alignments:

#### triangular_msa

To create average hydropathy profiles based on the MSAs, a triangular
sliding window can be used. There are two main steps in this procedure.

1. For every sequence in the MSA its own window-averaged hydropathy
profile is calculated first. Due to a presence of gaps in the MSA, the
sliding window in this case is flexible, i.e. its length can be extended
by a number of gaps found on every side of the window, so that the
window of a specified length N still covers N non-gappy positions.

2. After average hydropathy profiles have been calculated for every
sequence in the MSA, the average hydropathy profile of the entire MSA is
calculated by averaging hydrophobicity values at every position in the
MSA. At every position of the MSA hydrophobicity values are summed up,
while gaps are ignored. Then the total sum at every position of the MSA
is divided by the number of non-gaps.
